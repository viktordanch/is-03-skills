## Project Overview

Excalidraw is an open-source, collaborative virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn-like diagrams. Built with React and TypeScript, it uses a custom Canvas 2D rendering engine and custom state management via `actionManager`.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **UI**: React 19 (functional components, hooks only)
- **Build**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Package Manager**: Yarn 1.x with workspaces
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier

## Key Commands

- `yarn` — install dependencies
- `yarn start` — start dev server (excalidraw-app)
- `yarn build` — build the app
- `yarn test:app` — run Vitest tests
- `yarn test:typecheck` — TypeScript type checking
- `yarn test:code` — ESLint
- `yarn test:other` — Prettier check
- `yarn test:all` — run all checks
- `yarn fix` — auto-fix linting and formatting

## Architecture

- **State Management**: custom `actionManager` (NOT Redux/Zustand/MobX). State updates via `actionManager.dispatch()` only. State type: `AppState` in `packages/excalidraw/types.ts`.
- **Rendering**: Canvas 2D rendering via custom engine (NOT React DOM for drawing). Pipeline: Scene -> `renderScene()` -> canvas 2D context.
- **Monorepo**: Yarn workspaces with `@excalidraw/*` package aliases defined in `tsconfig.json`.

## Conventions

- Functional components with hooks only (no class components)
- Named exports only (no default exports)
- Props type: `{ComponentName}Props`
- Colocated tests: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`
- SCSS modules or CSS custom properties for styling
- kebab-case for utility files, PascalCase for components

## Skills

Project agent skills live under [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/). Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` (and may include `scripts/`, `references/`, or other support files). Use the skill that matches the task; follow its workflows and project constraints (especially `actionManager` and the canvas pipeline).

| Skill | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `creating-excalidraw-components` | Adding or changing React UI (panels, dialogs, toolbars) with Excalidraw’s naming, props, and test patterns. |
| `excalidraw-ui-architecture` | Narrowing `AppState` / prop surfaces, or splitting files that mix React UI with scene/renderer/canvas concerns; includes `appstate-prop-minimizer` and `extract-canvas-ui-boundaries` helper scripts. |
| `imageoptimize` | Compressing, converting, or resizing web images (PNG, JPEG, WebP, SVG) with quality in mind. |
| `polishing` | Finishing a change before handoff: cleanup, checks, and merge-ready quality pass without new features. |
